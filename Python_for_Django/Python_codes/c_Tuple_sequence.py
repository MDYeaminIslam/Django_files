#Tuple is immutable
#Tuple -> Sequence data type
#tuple()
tp = ([1,2,243,23],[534,232,45])
print(tp)
#we can edit list under a tuple but we can't access or change main tuple value
#single element tuple
tuple1 = ("Yeamin",) #we have to give comma end of element
print(tuple1)

#tuple is best for heterogenous value means mixed values
#list is best for homogenous value that means same type values
